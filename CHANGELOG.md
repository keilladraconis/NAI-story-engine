# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-04

### Breaking Changes

- **Complete architectural rewrite** — This version is not compatible with data from previous versions. Install in a new story.
- Removed legacy services: `agent-workflow.ts`, `hyper-generator.ts`, `story-manager.ts`, `sega-service.ts`, `lorebook-sync-service.ts`, and others.
- Removed `GEMINI.md`, `PLAN.md`, `CODEREVIEW.md` planning documents.

### Added

#### New Framework Libraries (`lib/`)

- **nai-store.ts** — Redux-like state management with `createSlice`, `dispatch`, `useSelector`, and `subscribeEffect` for side effects.
- **nai-act.ts** — Component framework with `describe()` for static UI structure and `onMount()` for reactive subscriptions.
- **gen-x.ts** — Complete rewrite of generation queue engine with budget management, pause/resume, and pub/sub state updates.

#### New Store Architecture (`src/core/store/`)

- Centralized state management with four slices:
  - `story` — Field contents and DULFS items
  - `brainstorm` — Chat messages
  - `ui` — Edit modes, temporary inputs, lorebook selection
  - `runtime` — Generation queue status, GenX state, SEGA orchestration
- Effects system for side effects triggered by state changes
- Automatic persistence via `api.v1.storyStorage`

#### New UI Components (`src/ui/components/`)

- `GenerationButton` — Unified generation button with queue status, timer display, and cancellation
- `ButtonWithConfirmation` — Reusable confirmation dialog pattern
- `TextField` — Text/multiline field with edit mode toggle and generation
- `ListField` / `ListItem` — DULFS list management with lorebook sync
- `LorebookPanelContent` — Lorebook panel for generating entry content and keys
- Brainstorm components: `List`, `Input`, `Message`
- Sidebar components: `Header`, `SettingField`, `FieldList`

#### New Features

- **Lorebook Panel** — Generate content and keys for any lorebook entry directly from the Lorebook view.
- **ATTG & Style Sync** — Author/Title/Tags/Genre syncs to Memory, Style Guidelines syncs to Author's Note.
- **Setting Field** — Quick setting input (e.g., "Star Wars", "Original") for non-original fanfiction contexts.
- **Improved S.E.G.A.** — Round-robin scheduling across DULFS categories, status display, proper cancellation.
- **JIT Strategy Building** — Message factories build generation context at execution time, not queue time.

### Changed

- Generation uses `api.v1.generate()` directly via GenX instead of the old HyperGenerator wrapper.
- All UI updates use `api.v1.ui.updateParts()` — no re-rendering, just targeted mutations.
- Element IDs centralized in `src/ui/framework/ids.ts` with consistent prefixes.
- Context building moved to `src/core/utils/context-builder.ts` with layered prompt construction.
- Lorebook strategies extracted to `src/core/utils/lorebook-strategy.ts`.

### Removed

- `hyper-generator.ts` — Replaced by GenX.
- `agent-workflow.ts` — Replaced by effects system.
- `story-manager.ts`, `story-data-manager.ts` — Replaced by store slices.
- `brainstorm-service.ts`, `brainstorm-data-manager.ts` — Replaced by store + effects.
- `sega-service.ts` — Replaced by `effects/sega.ts`.
- `lorebook-sync-service.ts` — Replaced by effects in `effects.ts`.
- `unified-generation-service.ts`, `dulfs-service.ts` — Replaced by generation handlers.
- `context-strategies.ts`, `field-strategies.ts` — Replaced by `context-builder.ts`.
- `brainstorm-ui.ts`, `story-engine-ui.ts`, `structured-editor.ts` — Replaced by nai-act components.
- `ui-components.ts` — Replaced by individual component files.
- `debouncer.ts` — No longer needed with new architecture.
- `subscribable.ts` — Replaced by nai-store subscriptions.

### Fixed

- Streaming lag in brainstorm chat resolved.
- Generation button state properly reflects queue status.
- Pause/resume behavior works correctly during generation.
- Lorebook entries update immediately when DULFS item names change.

### Developer Notes

- See `CLAUDE.md` for coding guidelines and architecture overview.
- Strict TypeScript: `noImplicitAny`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters` enabled.
- Test coverage is minimal (~6%) — expansion planned for v0.5.
